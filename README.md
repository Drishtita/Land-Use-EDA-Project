# Land-Use-EDA-Project
This project presents an exploratory data analysis on land use classification across Indian states (2000â€“2020) using government data. Key trends in forest cover, agricultural land, fallow areas, and barren land were visualized using Python to uncover regional patterns and temporal changes for better policy and planning decisions.
