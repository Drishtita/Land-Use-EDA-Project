# Land-Use-EDA-Project
# 🌾 Land Use Analysis Across Indian States (2000–2020)

This project explores the land use patterns across Indian states over two decades using government data. Using Python and EDA techniques, it highlights trends and insights in agricultural land, forest cover, barren land, and more to support policy planning and resource allocation.

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Excel (for comparative cross-checks)

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Understand regional land use trends over two decades.  
2. Identify states with highest/lowest forest/agricultural cover.  
3. Analyze temporal changes in fallow, barren, and urban land.  
4. Correlate land use categories with each other.  
5. Visualize data interactively for better decision-making.

## 📈 Methodologies

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- Handling Missing Values  
- Aggregation and Grouping  
- Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps, trendlines, etc.)

## 📌 Key Insights

- Agricultural land dominates in most Indian states but is slowly declining in urbanized areas.  
- Forest cover shows a slight improvement in the northeast.  
- Fallow land trends suggest declining usage or poor soil productivity in some zones.

## 💡 Future Scope

- Add predictive modeling for land use forecasting  
- Combine with population, rainfall, and economic datasets  
- Develop an interactive dashboard using Plotly or Power BI
